Please refer to the document "Migrating from Teradata to Azure SQL Data Warehouse" for details on how to use the tool.

That document gives insight into how to approach a Teradata to Azure SQL Data Warehouse migration. It is broken into sections which detail the migration phases,
the preparation required for data migration including schema migration, migration of the business logic, the actual data migration approach and testing strategy. 
The migration should pivot on six areas (one is optional but highly recommended) and, with the benefit of Azure, you can get ahead of the development curve by 
quickly being able to provision Azure SQL Data Warehouses for your development team to start business object migration before the data is migrated.
The use of an agile methodology, with focus on what must be delivered, to provide a working environment and any items that are “nice to haves” will achieve a 
foundation from which to build upon within Azure.
