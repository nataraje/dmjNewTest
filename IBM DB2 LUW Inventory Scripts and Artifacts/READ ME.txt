SQL query that hits IBM DB2 system tables 
- So far, only tested so far on IBM DB2 LUW version 11.1
- Non-evasive query
- Count of objects by schema and object type
- Gives a rough estimate of ‘Raw Data’ in each schema
- Provides a sizing of tables in each schema
Results are stored in a CSV

Benefits
- Helps classify schemas (simple, moderate, complex, custom)
- Helps target high-profile schemas for analysis
- Helps identify user accounts too
- Sizing information
- Goes beyond identifying SSMA objects (only a couple, working on adding more)
