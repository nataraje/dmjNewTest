Oracle_csv_xml.zip
==================
This one takes a csv file as entry (sources.csv in the project folders) to produce the xml files needed to run SSMA assessment in console mode.
The source.csv is produced by customer who has the inventory of his Oracle instances.
Output files are AssessmentReportGeneration_source_1.xml, ServersConnectionFile.xml, VariableValueFile.xml

Launcher.txt
============
Is actually launcher.cmd to launch the ssmafororacleconsole tool

Convert.xlsm
============
This one is used to convert all the report.xml files for each and every assessment in Excel format, this was needed for the next step which loads these spreadsheets into an SQL table using a linked server. The link server could not read the the xml files without this conversion step.

Setup.sql
=========
This script enable and create a linked server to Excel/Office, create a table where we consolidate all the SSMA assessment reports so customer has a consolidated view of migration efforts and can drill down to a single instance/schema.
We took only the assessment summary sheet from the whole workbook.
